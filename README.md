# BioPhoneSurvey

This site holds the website for a project in Biology class that my team and I did.

This repository probably isn't of much benefit to the general public, but if you're here and interested, read ahead I guess.

1. This site was coded by me (yes, making my own site was totally an excuse to code in class)
2. This site holds all the surveys used in the experiment.


The general hypothesis of this experiment was that, if a student has a cell phone on their person (not in use, just on them), then there will be no significant change in the student's grades, behavior, and mental feelings.

This project is my final exam for Biology, so I hope I did ok on this :)


Now that the experimental phase is complete, we collected are results, and out hypothesis was proven correct, with about a 0.06 point change in the participants' GPAs and with no noticeable behavioral impacts.
